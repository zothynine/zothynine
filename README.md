### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mario.
No not that plumber guy. I sometimes feel like a plumber though.

- I'm a Senior Frontend-Developer at [Der Standard](https://www.derstandard.at) by day.
- Iâ€™m currently working on a game for the Playdate handheld [Playdate](https://play.date) by night.
- I love [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and [Playdate](https://play.date).
- I have a great idea for an arcade related project but no time for it :-(
- I used to play bass, now I tinker around in [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm).
- Pronouns: he/him
