### Hi there 👋 I'm Mario.
No not that plumber guy. I sometimes feel like a plumber though.

- I’m currently working on a javascript [lightbox](https://github.com/zothynine/LastLightbox) (very early stage).
- I love [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
- I have a great idea for an arcade related project but no time for it :-(
- I used to play bass, now I tinker around in [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm) and [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com).
